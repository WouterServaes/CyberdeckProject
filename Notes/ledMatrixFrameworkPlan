Serial Device Framework Plan
--------------------------------


----- Raspberry pi LED 8x8 Matrix framework 
	based on the luma.core API



C++ Framework able to maintain specific objects (matrix, display, ...).
Each object is able to run a python script on a different thread.

Python scripts used because ease of use with the hardware devices
C++ used because it's what I know

-> How to interrupt the for loops in the python scripts?
	-> Use python script global variable, and only run the script on a different thread or subprocess
	-> Make while loop of python read the cout from the c++ thread, c++ can write "end" to it

	1) Get the process ID of the python script:  ps ax | grep testLedMatrix
	2) Signal SIGUSR1 to this ID:  kill -n SIGUSR1 <id>
	3) Handle SIGUSR1 in the python script to stop the loop



why this framework:
	- being able to create complex application without luma.core and other device code.
	- this drawing code can be generalized anyway
	- good base for future devices (other led displays)
