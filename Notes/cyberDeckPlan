Cyberdeck Plan
-----------------


Use the led matrix framework plan to incorporate display devices that display info like:
	- system information
	- network information
	- information from other devices (eg work with Pi HAT and other sensors)

Add Modbus and mbus readout functionality through gpi




About GPIO things:
	it might be possible to share gpio pins (like I2C pins)
